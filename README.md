Hi! I’m Falguni Murade, a Computer Engineering student passionate about learning Java, writing clean logic, and improving problem-solving skills through consistent coding practice.

This repository contains my Java and DSA practice programs, organized topic-wise to build strong fundamentals and logical thinking.

📚 Topics Covered

✅ Arrays
✅ Number Programs
✅ Function / Method Programs
✅ String Programs

🔜 More DSA topics will be added gradually.

📂 Folder Structure

Arrays
Programs based on array traversal, searching, and basic array logic.

NumberPrograms
Logic-based programs such as prime number, palindrome, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

FunctionCallPrograms
Programs demonstrating method creation, function calling, parameter passing, and reusability.
